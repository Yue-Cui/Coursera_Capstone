The background: most retail stores and restaurants rely on the location data to determine the prime locations for their business. For this assignment, I decided to segment different districts in Los Angelas and to determine the best location for different categories of merchants. New merchants can use this KNN model to determine which destrict to open their business based on the categories of business they are in and the number of competitions nearby.
