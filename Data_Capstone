For this capstone project, I will be using foursquare data to find out about the merchants around Los Angelas and organise them based
on their zip codes. Then I will scrape the data from http://www.laalmanac.com/communications/cm02_communities.php to determine the
neighborhood of merchants based on their zip codes. 

After both the merchants data and the zip codes are collected, I will find out the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method, and
then explore the different areas using visualization.

After I find out the characteristics of different areas, I will be able to makes recommendations about the prime locations for retail 
stores and restaurants.
